<h1>Online Portfolio</h1>

<p>As I've mentioned, I love to learn and keep myself busy. During the summer of 2017, I spent about a month or so teaching myself the basics of HTML/CSS in order to create my own, from scratch, online portfolio website. For someone with no formal training in web development, I'd like to think I did a pretty good job! One of the most challenging things was learning some of the responsive aspects of web design, such has elements of my page that have different properties when you hover over them. I did some online tutorials and read through a lot of forums to get as much information as possible. I quickly picked up on formatting patterns and popular trends in web desing, such as the parallax scrolling feature, as I went along. I want to continue to improve upon it and am now teaching myself React JS to make it more visually appealing and smoother. </p>
