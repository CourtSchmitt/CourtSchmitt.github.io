<h1>Senior Design</h1>

       <p>Every Johns Hopkins Mechanical Engineering student prior to graduation will have completed an intensive year long capstone design project. Groups of students were assebled and given autonomy in solving a problem outlined by their client, an incredible learning experience to the design process, from conception, design, prototype, testing, and final product. I got lucky with my first choice project to help build an enclosure for one of the research teams' optical telescope set up at the Space Science Telescope Institute. The current set up does not meet certain standards that the team requires in order to get the most accurate results. It is still early on in the year to go into detail with what we will end up building for them, but so far we have had several meetings brainstorming some small fixes we can make in the first few weeks and presenting CAD models of early prototype ideas we have including a physical design and some material options for the enclosure. </p>
